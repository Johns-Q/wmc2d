.SH NAME
wmc2d \- a coretemp/cpufreq monitor dockapp

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wmc2d
.BI [\-?|\-h]
.BI [\-c \ first ]
.BI [\-j]
.BI [\-n \ cpus ]
.BI [\-r \ rate ]
.BI [\-s]
.BI [\-t \ freq ]
.BI [\-w]
.BI [\-z \ zones ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a small dockapp, which shows the core temperature and cpu frequency
from 2 upto 4 cores/cpus and the temperature of upto two ACPI thermal zones,
which are normaly the motherboard temperature.
.PP
All cpus, which are supported by the linux kernel "coretemp" and "cpufreq"
modules, could be monitored.  f.e. core 2, atom and core iX.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-?|\-h
Show short usage help and exit.  The help is printed to stdout.  A note to all
developers: please print to stdout!
.TP
.B \-c first
Number of the first CPU to use in this dockapp, can be used to monitor more
than 4 core or cpus, with multiple dockapps.
.TP
.B \-j
Join two CPUs, only the information of every second core is displayed.
(Useful for hyper-threading CPUs)
.TP
.B \-n cpus
Number of CPUs to display.  Currently only 2 or 4 CPUs are supported,  if you
need others, please make a feature request or send a patch.
.TP
.B \-r rate
Refresh rate of the temperature and frequency informations in milliseconds,
defaults to 1500ms.  Shorter means more CPU usage and more updates.
.TP
.B \-s
Sleep while screen-saver is running or video is blanked.  The dockapp sleeps
and did't use any CPU cyles, while the display is switched off.  Saves energy
on laptops.
.TP
.B \-t freq
Turbo boost frequency in Mhz (f.e. 1734000 for 1.73 Ghz), when the turbo
boost frequency is reached, the frequency is shown in red.
.TP
.B \-w
Start in window mode, used for debugging.  The dockapp gets the normal window
borders and title.
.TP
.B \-z zones
Number of ACPI thermal zones to display.  Currently only 0, 1 or 2 are
supported.  Thermal zone 0 is normaly the motherboard temperature.
