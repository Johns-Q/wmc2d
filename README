This is a small dockapp, which shows the core temperature and cpu frequency
from 2 upto 4 cores/cpus and the temperature of upto two thermal zones,
which are normaly the motherboard temperature.

All cpus, which are supported by the linux kernel "coretemp" and "cpufreq"
modules, could be monitored.  f.e. core 2, atom and core iX.

All thermal zones which could be read from files are supported.  f.e.  ACPI
through /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zoneX/temp or hardware sensors through
/sys/devices/platform/<chip>/tempX_input.

To compile you must have libxcb (xcb-dev) installed.

You can enable/disable screen-saver support see wmc2d.c beginning of the file.
(default is enabled)

Just make make and play.

Use wmc2d -h to see the command line options.

Requires:
	x11-libs/libxcb
		X C-language Bindings library
		http://xcb.freedesktop.org/
	x11-libs/xcb-util
		X C-language Bindings sample implementations
